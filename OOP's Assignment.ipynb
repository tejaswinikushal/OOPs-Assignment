    "1.Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data (attributes) and methods (functions) together within a class. It allows data to be hidden and accessed only through defined methods, promoting data protection and abstraction.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Inheritance: Inheritance enables the creation of new classes (derived classes) based on existing classes (base or parent classes). The derived classes inherit attributes and methods from the parent class, allowing code reuse and the establishment of hierarchical relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a commonsuperclass. It enables the use of a single interface to represent various data types, facilitating code flexibility and extensibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Abstraction: Abstraction involves representing essential features and behaviors of objects while hiding unnecessary details. It allows the creation of abstract classes and interfaces, defining a contract for derived classes to follow. Abstraction helps manage complexity and focus on essential aspects of objects and their interactions.\n",

    "In object-oriented programming (OOP), the self parameter is used to refer to the instance of a class within the class itself. It is a convention to name this parameter as self, although it can be named differently. The purpose of self is to differentiate between instance variables and local variables within a class and to access the attributes and methods of the object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the main reasons why self is used in OOP:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Accessing instance variables: The self parameter allows us to access the instance variables (attributes) of an object within the class. By using self.attribute_name, we can refer to and manipulate the specific attributes of the object.\n",
    "2.Invoking instance methods: With self, we can call the instance methods of a class from within the class itself. By using self.method_name(), we can invoke the methods defined in the class on the specific object.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Differentiating between local and instance variables: When a method or function is defined within a class, it may have local variables with the same names as the instance variables. To differentiate between the local variables and the instance variables, we use self.attribute_name to refer to the object's attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Passing the instance as a reference: When an object calls a method on itself, the self parameter is implicitly passed as the first argument. This allows the method to operate on the specific object that invoked it.\n",
